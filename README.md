# Open-Loop-and-Closed-Loop-Analysis-and-Design-Controllers-Based-on-The-Desired-Characteristics
This is the class project designed for the "Computer Applications in Control" course in Winter 2018 (2nd semester/Academic year: 2017-2018)

1- Open loop analysis(Step response)

Find Mp, Tp, Tr, Ts, Ess.

Plot Bode & Nyquist diagrams.

Find gain margin & phase margin.

Plot root Locus diagrams.

2- Design the following controllers based on the desired characteristics.

a. Lead-lag controller.

Time domain with root Locus method.

Frequency domain with bode method

b. PID controller.

c. State feedback controller.

3- Simulate & implement the closed-loop system with all above controllers, separately in the Simulink.

Plot the control signal.

Compare the closed-loop output and input signals with the different designed controllers.

4- Investigate the effect of variations of the main model parameters without changing the controllers and compare the results. 
(For example: change the value of a model parameter by 10%)
